This is the Repo for the Project Persefone. In here, you will find the parts for running the program,
including the Readme (that you're reading!) and a sample image for testing.

1. Introduction:

  This programs was created for my (Iván) undergraduate theses, which is named "Advances towards the automatic transcription".
  While it sounds ambicious, have in mind that this technology is still in its infancy in the Latin American region, at least
  in the philological field. What this means is the application of neural networks and machine learning in the aforementioned
  area. I know that in many countries this field has been researched, like the Transcribus project in the EU and the works
  of many ilustrious professors, such as Tara L. Andrews. Taking the challenge of making a product that unites the knowledge 
  of classical philology and the "techné" of software engineering wasn´t easy. I had to ask my childhood friend and colleague
  Santiago Buitrago for help with the programming. He kindly accepted and took part in this endeavour, teaching me the basics
  of Python and helping me with the creation of the code. By rule, this makes him co-creator and co-owner of this code, so you,
  The Reader, may see the same files in another repo. About this I will explain with more depth in the third part of this Readme.
